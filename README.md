# ft_linear_regression

A simple linear regression project implemented in **Godot 4.5**. This project predicts car prices based on mileage using gradient descent, with a live visualization of the learning process and loss landscape.  

## Features
- Linear regression with a single feature (mileage).  
- Interactive program to predict car prices.  
- Gradient descent training.  
- Visualization of dataset distribution and regression line.  
- Live loss landscape to observe gradient descent in action.
  
## How to Use
1. Open the project in **Godot 4.5**.  
2. Run the **Main scene** to start the project.   
3. Watch the loss and parameter updates in real time !
4. You can re-randomize the parameters to re-observe the training.  

## Tech Stack
- Godot 4.5 (GDScript)  
- Linear regression implemented from scratch (no external ML libraries).
